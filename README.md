# task-checker
A simple Task Checker web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you add daily tasks, check them off when done, and organize them by date on a calendar. Tasks are saved using localStorage, so your progress stays even after closing the site. Designed with a dark navy theme, bright blue highlights, and a clean MVP style.
